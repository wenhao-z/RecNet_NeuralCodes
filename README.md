# System Requirements
The code was developed on MATLAB R2018b and can be ran on MATLAB with new version.
The `simExpMdls.m` can be ran on a standand computer with enough RAM. The computer should have at least 8GB of RAM.
The `Cluster_code\simNet_ScanPars.m` should be ran on a high performance cluster (HPC). 
The user needs to revise `simNet_ScanPars.m` based on the job scheduler or mangement on the HPC.
